ORM Extension
-------------

OpenLib provides an extension to the basic OpenERP ORM. Its main goal is to simplify everyday call to the OpenERP
API. For example, you don't have to pass the ``cr``, ``uid`` or ``context`` variables anymore. The ORM Extension
is not intrusive, you can enable it on your objects if you want, but it's not mandatory at all.
